# Dissimilarity-dataset-characterization

This repository features tables, source code, and all materials relative to the experiments presented in the paper "Sensible characterization of datasets : A dissimilarity approach"

- "Dissimilarity meta-attributes.xlsx" details the generic and feature-specific meta-attributes used in the dissimilarity
- "Theoretical validation.xlsx" details the algorithm and classifiers from OpenML used in theoretical validation
- "Experimental validation.xlsx" details the algorithm, classifiers, and evaluation from OpenML used in experimental validation, the extracted meta-attributes, as well as the evaluated Meta-classifiers and feature selection methods
- "src" folder contains the source code for the experiment described in Experimental validation 
- "Ressources" folder contains the meta-dataset constructed from openML in a format exploitable by the program
